# Twimages
#### Inline images (and other enhancements) for Twitch chat

This is a userscript that requires either Greasemonkey for Firefox, or Tampermonkey for Chrome.  I imagine it will work in other contexts as well, but those are the only two userscript plugins I've tested it with.

## Features
* Inserts images sent as links into the chat
* Highlights messages containing your username
* Provides an "@" link by usernames to quickly reply to a user in chat

## Installation
* Install Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey (depending on your browser of choice)
* Click [here](https://github.com/SammyIAm/Twimages/raw/master/twimages.user.js) (or on the "raw" link on the [source page for the twimages.user.js](https://github.com/SammyIAm/Twimages/blob/master/twimages.user.js) file)
* Enter Twitch chat, and enjoy!
